# Sales_Forecasting_p
This project focuses on retail sales forecasting using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Linear Regression modeling in Python. The dataset contains sales records along with influencing factors such as advertising spend (TV &amp; online) and product pricing.


ðŸ”¹ Key Steps Performed:

Conducted EDA to understand sales trends, detect patterns, and analyze relationships between sales and predictors.

Built a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on marketing and pricing features.

Achieved an RÂ² score of 0.87, indicating strong predictive performance.

Visualized actual vs. predicted sales for model validation.

Implemented a forecasting module to estimate future sales given planned advertising budgets and pricing.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries:

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)

Google Colab for implementation

ðŸ”¹ Outcome:
The project demonstrates how regression techniques can be applied to real-world retail sales forecasting, providing businesses with actionable insights for marketing and pricing strategies.
